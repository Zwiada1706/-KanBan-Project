## Branching Strategies

* Branching Strategy is a strategy that allows developers to collaborate on a project while also tracking changes and maintaining multpile versions of the database.There are many git branching strategies of which eact has its own ups and downs.

* I will be using the GitFlow branching strategy 

* My branching strategy aims to:  
 Enhance productivity by ensuring proper coordination among developers  
 Enable parallel development  
 Help organize a series of planned, structured releases  
 Map a clear path when making changes to software through to production  

* This branching strategy consists of the following branches:  

 Master  
 Develop
