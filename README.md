## Repositories
In This Entire IT Developments Module, I will be creating 5 repositories including the one we're currently in namely:

* Project 1
* Project 2
* Project 3
* Project 4
* Project 5

## Branching Strategies

* Branching Strategy is a strategy that allows developers to collaborate on a project while also tracking changes and maintaining multpile versions of the database.There are many git branching strategies of which eact has its own ups and downs.

* I will be using the GitFlow branching strategy 
* My branching strategy aims to:  
 -Enhance productivity by ensuring proper coordination among developers  
 -Enable parallel development  
 -Help organize a series of planned, structured releases  
 -Map a clear path when making changes to software through to production  

* This branching strategy consists of the following branches:  
  -Master  
  -Develop  

## Uses of .gitignore file within each project

The .gitignore file is a crucial component in a version-controlled project using Git. It specifies patterns for files or directories that Git should ignore, meaning they won't be tracked by Git's version control system. This is particularly useful to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository, which can help keep your repository clean, reduce unnecessary clutter, and prevent sensitive information from being accidentally shared. Here are some common use cases for the .gitignore file:  

>Ignoring Temporary Files: Various development tools and editors generate temporary files or backups (e.g., .DS_Store on macOS, *.swp files from Vim). These files can be safely ignored, as they are not relevant to the project's codebase.  


>There are also pre-made .gitignore templates available for various programming languages, frameworks, and IDEs that you can use as a starting point and customize as needed.  

When creating a .gitignore file, it's important to tailor it to the specific needs of your project and the tools you're using.  

## Storage of Credentials and sensitive information

* Storing credentials and sensitive information in a secure and responsible manner is crucial to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.

* Here are some of the storage credentials and sensitive protection of information I will be doing
> Avoiding Hardcoding Credentials
 
> The Use Environment Variables

> Configuration Of Files

> Version-Controlled Template  
Most credentials will be stored using the Git Credential Manager (GCM) is another way to store your credentials securely and connect to GitHub over HTTPS.
